This is my first project: a fully functional Blackjack game written in JavaScript! 
It simulates a real deck that updates with each game and includes an automatic shuffle option,
which activates whenever the deck doesn’t have enough cards for a new round.
Players can place bets on each turn, adding an extra layer of excitement to the game. If you lose all your money, it’s game over! 
This project was an exciting way to learn JavaScript, and I’m looking forward to further refining it as I improve my skills.
