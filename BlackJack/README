my first javascript web project, created a blackjack game. main features are: *the amount of decks can be chosen *that cards that are drawn from the deck cant be drawn again until shuffle button is pressed

first time expirencing with html and css it was a lot of fun ! hope to make greater, bigger and more complex projects in the future using these tools.
