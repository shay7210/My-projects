This project is an interactive tool built with React to visualize sorting algorithms in arrays, 
inspired by my recent completion of a data structure course.
It includes visualizations for bubble sort, insertion sort, quicksort, and merge sort, showcasing each algorithm's step-by-step behavior in real-time. 
This tool offers a hands-on, intuitive way to explore and understand sorting algorithms, making it a great resource for both learning and demonstration.
Through this project, Iâ€™ve solidified my understanding of data structures and enhanced my React development skills.
