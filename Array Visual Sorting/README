This is my second project, built with React, focused on visualizing data structures to reinforce concepts I recently covered in my data structure course.
The first part of this project features interactive visualizations of array sorting algorithms,
including bubble sort, insertion sort, and quicksort, with merge sort currently in progress.
Each visualization showcases the step-by-step behavior of the algorithms, providing an intuitive, hands-on learning experience.
This project has been a valuable way to solidify my understanding of sorting algorithms while enhancing my React skills.
