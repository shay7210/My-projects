This program takes in a CSV file containing a list of points that represent the positions of cones.
The program processes these points to create a visual representation of the track using Pygame,
displays the cones on the screen, and creates a path for the kart to follow.
As the kart moves along the track, the program dynamically calculates and displays the angle of the kart, 
ensuring the kart's orientation is correct. It also displays the kart's position (x, y) and the angle (Î¸).
Using this program requires installation of pygame library,
type 'pip install pygame' in the terminal to install the package
To initilize the program run trackCreator.py file
